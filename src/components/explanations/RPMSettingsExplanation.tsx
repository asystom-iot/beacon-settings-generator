          RPM MAX and RPM MIN define a rotation speed search window. It shall include the expected
          RPM variation range for the machine being monitored. It is important to properly set the
          RPM search window; else balancing and alignment indicators do not provide valid values. By
          default, the range is setup for 1500 RPM machines (1320 â€“ 1680 RPM) since 1500 RPM
          asynchronous motors are commonplace in the industry.
